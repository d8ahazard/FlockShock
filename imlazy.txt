# Game Concept: Flock Shock

---

## Overview
**Flock Shock** is a casual, top-down browser/mobile game about managing a herd of fainting goats. Players must guide their vulnerable goats away from danger, using amusing, indirect deterrents to keep the herd safe for as long as possible.

---

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Herd Behavior
- **Movement:** Goats continuously wander around the pasture, mildly unpredictable.
- **Fainting:** Sudden surprises or nearby predators cause goats to faint instantly, leaving them briefly immobilized and vulnerable.
- **Recovery:** Goats wake up automatically if unharmed after a short duration.

### Player Interaction (Controls)
- **Placement:** Players use mouse clicks (browser) or screen taps (mobile) to drop humorous deterrents strategically onto the pasture.
- **Zooming:** Players can zoom in/out (mouse wheel or pinch gestures) for detailed control or strategic overview of the entire pasture.

## Humorous Deterrent Tools

Players manage a limited inventory of funny items to control goat movements:

- **Screaming Rooster:** Loud crowing briefly scares goats into running away but risks temporary fainting.
- **Cardboard Predator:** Fake wolves or bears initially scare goats into fainting; once awake, goats humorously scatter away.
- **Farmhand Drone:** A buzzing quadcopter shaped like a farmer gently steers goats without causing fainting.
- **Bubble Wrap Path:** Causes immediate fainting once stepped on; goats afterward avoid these areas, useful for controlling long-term goat paths.

---

## Hazards and Predators

- **Wolves/Coyotes:** Predators periodically enter, chasing goats.
- **Sudden Thunderstorm:** Lightning and thunder randomly trigger herd-wide fainting, requiring quick player intervention.
- **Runaway Farm Equipment:** Random tractors or hay bales occasionally roll through, requiring rapid goat rerouting.

---

## Visuals and Tone
- Bright, whimsical, cartoon aesthetics.
- Comedic animations emphasizing goatsâ€™ fainting, panic, and confused recovery.
- Humorous sound design with fainting bleats, goofy predator noises, and comedic item sound effects.

---

## Progression and Replayability

- **Infinite Gameplay:** Game continues indefinitely; difficulty gradually escalates.
- **Achievements:** Reward humorous titles for milestones ("Lord of the Faint," "Goat Whisperer," "Master of the Rooster").
- **Leaderboards:** Compete globally or with friends based on survival duration, goat survival rates, or minimal fainting incidents.
